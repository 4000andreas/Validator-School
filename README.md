# Validator School

- Do you want to become a Validator, but don't know how to start?
- Are you looking for a mentor who will explain the specifics of validation?
- Need online support for running a validator on the main-net?

[DVS](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity) and [Sputnik Foundation](https://github.com/Sputnik-Foundation/About-Sputnik-Foundation) launch a **Validator School**, which will help you acquire the necessary knowledge to validate blockchains, and will provide full online support from the beginning to the launch of the validator. <br />
The most capable students will be able to synchronize with the **DVS**. <br />

## Process for participation in the Validator School

1. Fill the application for participation in the **Validator School**:
- [In english](https://forms.gle/8J8yTjv4DndYQXnMA)
- [In russian](https://forms.gle/NHUdTsTPzMBoS5E4A)

2. Join Telegram group of the **Validator School**, and write there that you have completed the application:
- [In english](https://t.me/joinchat/hP6xVEGmwkU1NmVi)
- [In russian](https://t.me/joinchat/GPwaOPPzQA04MzNi)

3. After reviewing your application, you need to participate in [The First Meet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y3WgGzWx6L11wARu9USBsOajVgzoWOxqddXqdM59fLg/edit?usp=sharing) (online meet), to clarify all questions. <br />
After the First Meet, if you are agree with the rules of educational proccess, your application will be approved. <br />

## If your application is approved

- You will be given a place in an educational group.
- Each group will be assigned several mentors who will accompany you throughout the training.
- Each group will have a schedule of online classes.
- To participate in the educational process, you need to have a personal computer (or laptop), an Internet connection to participate in online meetings and a microphone to participate in conversations. A video camera is not required. Some classes can be attended using a mobile phone.

## How the education process works

- The full course includes both: group and individual online lessons
- Classes include online lectures, practical seminars and workshops, and watching educational videos (homework)
- Learning takes place in stages: from simple to complex
- After the complete completion of the first stage, there is a transition to the second stage, and then to the third
- Transition to a more difficult stage is impossible without complete assimilation of the material from an easier stage
- In case of complete misunderstanding of a more difficult stage, the participant of School returns to an easier stage

- Education are divided into two parts: Technical and Humanities
- Each part consists of Theoretical and Practical lessons
- Education begins with the Humanitarian part, in order to give a complete picture of "what validation is" and "who a Validator is"

## What the full course of study includes

>> some seminars require financial costs, which the participant of the school assumes. <br />
>> in individual cases, financial costs can be reimbursed from the funds of the fundoundation <br />
