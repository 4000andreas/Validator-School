# Validator School

- Do you want to become a Validator, but don't know how to start?
- Are you looking for a mentor who will explain the specifics of validation?
- Need online support for running a validator on the main-net?

[DVS](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity) and [Sputnik Foundation](https://github.com/Sputnik-Foundation/About-Sputnik-Foundation) launch a **Validator School**, which will help you acquire the necessary knowledge to validate blockchains, and will provide full online support from the beginning to the launch of the validator. <br />
The most capable students will be able to synchronize with the **DVS**. <br />

## Process for participation in the Validator School

1. Fill the application for participation in the **Validator School**:
- [In english](https://forms.gle/C3xkaJtSnbcSirzw8)
- [In russian](https://forms.gle/Lz8n6cjzxmbS5fLt8)

2. Join Telegram group of the **Validator School**, and write there that you have completed the application:
- [In english](https://t.me/joinchat/hP6xVEGmwkU1NmVi)
- [In russian](https://t.me/joinchat/GPwaOPPzQA04MzNi)

3. After reviewing your application, you may be asked a few clarifying questions. <br />
Based on the data from your application, as well as based on the answers to additional questions, your application will be approved or rejected. <br />
If the application is rejected, it will be possible to re-submit it after 21 days. <br />

## If your application is approved

Depending on your application, you will either: <br />
- Provided the necessary knowledge (online consultation, links to documentation)
- Provided a place in the educational
- Provided a mentor represented by one of the [DVS validators](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity/blob/main/meet-our-validators.md)
- Provided online support and support from one of the [DVS validators](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity/blob/main/meet-our-validators.md)

## How the education process works

- The full course includes both: group and individual online lessons
- Classes include online lectures, practical seminars and workshops, and watching educational videos (homework)
- Learning takes place in stages: from simple to complex
- After the complete completion of the first stage, there is a transition to the second stage, and then to the third
- Transition to a more difficult stage is impossible without complete assimilation of the material from an easier stage
- In case of complete misunderstanding of a more difficult stage, the participant of School returns to an easier stage

- Education are divided into two parts: Technical and Humanities
- Each part consists of Theoretical and Practical lessons
- Education begins with the Humanitarian part, in order to give a complete picture of "what validation is" and "who a Validator is"

## What the full course of study includes

>> some seminars require financial costs, which the participant of the school assumes. <br />
>> in individual cases, financial costs can be reimbursed from the funds of the fundoundation <br />
